# URGENT: Email Delivery Not Working

## The Problem
Domain authentication ≠ Single Sender Verification

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)
1. Go to SendGrid → Settings → Sender Authentication → **Single Sender Verification**
2. Click "Create New Sender"
3. Use your personal email (like your Gmail)
4. Check your inbox for SendGrid verification email
5. Click the verification link
6. Tell me the verified email address

## What This Does
- Allows immediate email sending from your verified address
- No DNS changes needed
- Works instantly after verification

## Current Status
- Domain authentication ✅ (completed)
- Single sender verification ❌ (missing - this is why no emails send)
- System ready ✅ (just needs verified sender)

## Once Verified
I'll update the system to use your verified email and emails will start delivering immediately.

**This is the missing piece preventing email delivery.**
