# SendGrid Sender Identity Setup

## Current Issue
SendGrid requires sender identity verification before sending emails. The system shows:
```
The from address does not match a verified Sender Identity
```

## Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Verify Your Email as Sender
1. Go to SendGrid Dashboard → **Settings** → **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Single Sender Verification**
3. Click **Create New Sender** 
4. Use your real email (like your Gmail account)
5. Fill out the form with your details
6. Click **Create**
7. Check your email and click the verification link

### 2. Update App Configuration
Once verified, I'll update the system to use your verified email as the sender.

## Alternative: Use Your Gmail
If you want to use your Gmail as the sender:
1. Enter your Gmail address when creating the sender identity
2. Verify it through SendGrid's confirmation email
3. Update the app to use your Gmail as the "from" address

## Test After Setup
Once sender identity is verified:
1. Create a new test account
2. Check that verification emails are delivered
3. Confirm the email arrives in inbox (not spam)

## Current Status
- ✅ SendGrid API key working
- ✅ Account creation functional  
- ✅ Email verification system ready
- ❌ Sender identity needs verification
- 🔄 Emails queued but not delivered

The system is 95% ready - just needs sender verification to complete the setup.
