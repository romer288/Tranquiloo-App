You're right‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúempty-state‚Äù issue. The summaries exist, but they aren‚Äôt making it from the API ‚Üí portal in the shape the UI component actually reads. There are two common breaks I see from your snippets:

Field casing & names don‚Äôt match what the component uses.
Your normalizeSummary only guarantees snake_case fields (week_start, intervention_type, conversation_count) while many UI components (including typical earlier versions of your InterventionSummariesSection) read camelCase (weekStart, interventionType, conversationCount). If the component dereferences camelCase, it renders nothing.

user_id is missing when the server returns userId.
You keep ...s in normalizeSummary, but you don‚Äôt remap userId ‚Üí user_id. If the section filters by summary.user_id === patientId, you‚Äôll get zero items and nothing shows.

Below are surgical fixes you can drop in without touching your charts or other sections.

1) client/src/pages/TherapistPortal.tsx (inside PatientAnalytics)

Replace your normalizeSummary with a schema-agnostic version that preserves both snake_case and camelCase keys and ensures user_id is present:

// put above useEffect
const toArray = (v: unknown) =>
  Array.isArray(v)
    ? v
    : typeof v === 'string'
      ? v
          .replace(/^\{|\}$/g, '')     // handle Postgres '{a,b}' form
          .split(',')                  // split by comma
          .map(s => s.replace(/^"|"$/g, '').trim())
          .filter(Boolean)
      : [];

const normalizeSummary = (s: any, fallbackUserId: string) => {
  const userId = s.user_id || s.userId || fallbackUserId;

  const weekStart = s.week_start || s.weekStart || s.start || s.startDate || s.dateRangeStart;
  const weekEnd   = s.week_end   || s.weekEnd   || s.end   || s.endDate   || s.dateRangeEnd;

  const interventionType   = s.intervention_type || s.interventionType || s.type || 'unknown';
  const conversationCountN = Number(s.conversation_count ?? s.conversationCount ?? 0);

  const keyPts = toArray(s.key_points ?? s.keyPoints);
  const recs   = toArray(s.recommendations);
  const lims   = toArray(s.limitations ?? s.limitation_points);

  const createdAt = s.created_at || s.createdAt || weekEnd || weekStart || new Date().toISOString();

  return {
    // snake_case (backend style)
    id: String(s.id ?? `${userId}-${weekStart ?? Date.now()}`),
    user_id: userId,
    week_start: weekStart,
    week_end: weekEnd,
    intervention_type: interventionType,
    conversation_count: conversationCountN,
    key_points: keyPts,
    recommendations: recs,
    limitations: lims,
    created_at: createdAt,

    // camelCase (component-friendly)
    userId,
    weekStart,
    weekEnd,
    interventionType,
    conversationCount: conversationCountN,
    keyPoints: keyPts,
    createdAt,
  };
};


Then when you set summaries:

// after you compute rawSummaries
const rawSummaries =
  payload.summaries ??
  payload.interventions ??
  payload.interventionSummaries ??
  [];

// üëá ensure user_id is present and both casings exist
setSummaries(rawSummaries.map((s: any) => normalizeSummary(s, patientId)));


Add a one-time debug to verify you‚Äôre passing the right shape:

console.log('‚û°Ô∏è InterventionSummariesSection props:', {
  count: rawSummaries.length,
  first: rawSummaries[0],
  normalizedFirst: rawSummaries[0] && normalizeSummary(rawSummaries[0], patientId),
});

2) client/src/components/analytics/InterventionSummariesSection.tsx

Make this component schema-agnostic and never return null silently. At the very top of the component, normalize what it reads:

// inside component
const safeSummaries = (summaries ?? []).map((s: any) => ({
  id: s.id,
  userId: s.userId ?? s.user_id,
  weekStart: s.weekStart ?? s.week_start,
  weekEnd: s.weekEnd ?? s.week_end,
  interventionType: s.interventionType ?? s.intervention_type ?? s.type ?? 'unknown',
  conversationCount: s.conversationCount ?? s.conversation_count ?? 0,
  keyPoints: s.keyPoints ?? s.key_points ?? [],
  recommendations: s.recommendations ?? [],
  limitations: s.limitations ?? s.limitation_points ?? [],
  createdAt: s.createdAt ?? s.created_at,
}));

if (!safeSummaries.length) {
  return (
    <div className="text-center py-8">
      <div className="w-12 h-12 bg-blue-100 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center mx-auto mb-3">
        <MessageSquare className="w-6 h-6 text-blue-600" />
      </div>
      <p className="text-gray-500">No intervention summaries available yet</p>
    </div>
  );
}


If the component filters by patient, make sure it‚Äôs using s.userId as above (so either casing works).

3) server/routes.ts

Ensure the therapist endpoint actually returns the summaries array for the user id you pass from the client and with all columns needed by the UI:

// /api/therapist/patient-analytics
res.json({
  profile,
  analyses,
  messages,
  goals,
  summaries, // keep this exact key
});


(If you‚Äôre currently returning them under interventions or interventionSummaries, keep that too‚Äîbut the client now reads all three and normalizes.)

4) server/storage.ts

Double-check that getInterventionSummariesByUser(userId):

filters by the same user_id you send from the portal (the profile.id you pass as patientId),

selects all columns used by the UI (id, user_id, week_start, week_end, intervention_type, conversation_count, key_points, recommendations, limitations, created_at),

parses array-ish columns (if you store text arrays like {a,b}, return real arrays).

Example shape:

async function getInterventionSummariesByUser(userId: string) {
  // SELECT id, user_id, week_start, week_end, intervention_type,
  //        conversation_count, key_points, recommendations, limitations, created_at
  // FROM intervention_summaries
  // WHERE user_id = $1
  // ORDER BY week_start DESC;

  // If DB returns strings like '{...}', convert to string[]
}

5) shared/schema.ts

Define one canonical shape and stick to it in storage:

export interface InterventionSummary {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  week_start: string;   // ISO
  week_end: string;     // ISO
  intervention_type: string;
  conversation_count: number;
  key_points: string[];
  recommendations: string[];
  limitations: string[];
  created_at: string;   // ISO
}


(Your UI normalizer will also expose the camelCase aliases so the component is insulated.)

Quick validation checklist

Open the browser console when selecting a patient and verify:

Summaries from API: shows a positive rawSummaries count.

‚û°Ô∏è InterventionSummariesSection props: shows a normalizedFirst with both weekStart and week_start, both userId and user_id, and conversationCount is a number.

If the count is positive and the normalized object looks good, the section will render.

If the API returns data but user_id doesn‚Äôt match the selected patientId, you‚Äôll still see nothing in components that filter‚Äîconfirm both values match.

These changes keep the backend strict (snake_case) while making the frontend tolerant (reads both casings), which eliminates the silent ‚Äúnothing renders‚Äù outcome you‚Äôre seeing.
