what I produced for you (open the panels above)

Lines of code by area (client/src) – bar chart

Top external libraries in the client – table + bar chart

HTTP endpoints by method – bar chart

Endpoints grouped by resource – bar chart

All API endpoints – table (full list)

Database tables (Drizzle) – table + chart

High-signal unused dependencies – table

how the app works (quick mental model)

Stack / layout

Monorepo: client (React + shadcn/radix UI) / server (Node + Express) / shared (Drizzle schema).

DB layer: Drizzle ORM with the tables shown in the chart (e.g., profiles, chat_sessions, chat_messages, anxiety_analyses, user_goals, goal_progress, email_queue, …).

AI: server calls Anthropic Claude directly via fetch with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.

Email: server wraps SendGrid in server/emailService.ts.

Auth: custom lightweight auth (client/src/services/authService.ts) + Google OAuth (/auth/google routes).

Traffic flow

React UI (router + feature pages) calls your Express API under /api/*.

Express handlers in server/routes.ts call the storage layer in server/storage.ts (Drizzle) and services (email, AI).

DB reads/writes happen through the Drizzle models defined in shared/schema.ts.

What the charts say

Endpoints by method: mostly GET and POST (few PUT, no DELETE).

Endpoints grouped by resource: heaviest groups are api/therapist, api/profiles, api/users, api/chat-sessions, api/auth. You also have specific features like api/anxiety-analyses, api/recommend-app, api/analyze-anxiety-claude, etc.

Client libraries: a lot of path-aliased imports (@/...), plus react, lucide-react, @radix-ui/*, react-router-dom, class-variance-authority, three/@react-three/*, recharts, wouter (you’re using two routers: react-router and wouter).

things to delete or refactor (based on code scans)
1) Supabase

The package @supabase/supabase-js is installed but is never imported anywhere.

However, several files still call supabase.… (likely legacy code paths). There’s no global or client init, so these calls will either never run or will crash if they execute.

Files that still reference supabase (please refactor or remove):

client/src/components/track-anxiety/TrackAnxietyForm.tsx

client/src/pages/Index.tsx

client/src/pages/Registration.tsx

client/src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx

client/src/pages/TherapistPortal.tsx

client/src/services/analyticsExportService.ts

client/src/services/analyticsService.ts

client/src/services/authService.ts (has comments about replacing Supabase, but still mentions it)

client/src/services/chatService.ts

client/src/services/goalsService.ts

client/src/services/interventionSummaryService.ts

client/src/services/therapistDataService.ts

client/src/services/therapistReportService.ts

server/routes.ts (comment only: “replacing Supabase Edge Function”)

Action

Replace every supabase.from('…') read/write with the existing REST endpoints:

profiles → GET /api/profiles/:id, GET /api/profiles/by-email/:email

anxiety_analyses insert → POST /api/anxiety-analyses

chat sessions/messages → /api/chat-sessions, /api/chat-messages

goals & progress → /api/goals, /api/goal-progress

Once those references are gone, remove @supabase/supabase-js from package.json and lockfile; run a clean install.
You’ll also avoid shipping a large unused SDK to the client.

2) Dual routers

You’re importing both react-router-dom and wouter. That makes routing/state flow harder to reason about and increases bundle size.
Action: Pick one (recommend react-router-dom since it’s used more) and refactor the few wouter usages.

3) Heavy client libs

three/@react-three/* and recharts appear in the top libs.
Action: lazy-load those feature routes/components to keep first-load fast.

4) Email

server/emailService.ts uses SendGrid and warns if SENDGRID_API_KEY isn’t set (then it logs instead of sending).
Action: make sure the env var is set in prod; optionally push all email sends through a small queue table (email_queue) + background sender to decouple request latency.

5) Dependency sweep

The “High-signal unused dependencies” table I generated didn’t flag other obvious removals besides the Supabase SDK. If you want, I can run a stricter tree-shake check, but Supabase is the big one.
