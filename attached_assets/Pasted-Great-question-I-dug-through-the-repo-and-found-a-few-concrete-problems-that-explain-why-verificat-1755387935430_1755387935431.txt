Great question ‚Äî I dug through the repo and found a few concrete problems that explain why verification emails don‚Äôt go out and why users aren‚Äôt told to verify before sign-in. I also flagged duplicated/legacy code that‚Äôs getting in the way.

Below is a tight, actionable audit (with exact files & code changes). The treemaps I gave you earlier already show where code is ‚Äúorphaned‚Äù; I‚Äôm referencing those here so you can see what‚Äôs safe to delete vs. fix.

üî¥ Root-cause summary

Client uses the wrong endpoint for email sign-up/sign-in

client/src/services/authService.ts ‚Üí signInWithEmail() POSTs to /api/profiles and just stuffs a user object into localStorage.

That bypasses the server‚Äôs real auth route POST /api/auth/signin which:

Creates the user profile and generates a verification token.

Queues a verification email.

Enforces emailVerified (returns 403 EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED for existing accounts that haven‚Äôt verified).

Result: no verification email for the path the UI is using, and no ‚Äúverify first‚Äù block.

Email sender is running, but without SendGrid credentials it only logs

Server starts the queue processor in server/index.ts (emailService.startEmailProcessor() ‚úî).

server/emailService.ts returns true in ‚Äúsimulate‚Äù mode if SENDGRID_API_KEY is missing or invalid (so the queue marks emails as ‚Äúsent‚Äù even though they were only logged).

If you need real delivery, you must add a valid SendGrid API key and a verified sender (Single Sender Verification) or a verified domain.

Passwords aren‚Äôt validated anywhere

There‚Äôs no password column in shared/schema.ts.

POST /api/auth/signin only checks that a password was submitted, but doesn‚Äôt verify it. Existing verified users are accepted regardless of the password value.

On the client, updatePassword() is a no-op.

Google OAuth path bypasses verification & server session

GET /auth/google/callback writes to localStorage from an HTML page and doesn‚Äôt mark emailVerified in the DB.

This also bypasses server-side session/state. (It works, but it‚Äôs fragile.)

Legacy Supabase references and duplicated ‚Äúprofile create‚Äù logic

Many files still reference Supabase or create profiles directly via /api/profiles after auth; these duplicate/legacy paths cause inconsistent behavior and are shown as orphaned in the treemap.

‚úÖ What to change (minimal surgery, high impact)
A) Use the server auth route everywhere (enables verification + error codes)

client/src/services/authService.ts

Replace the current signInWithEmail body with a call to /api/auth/signin and enforce emailVerified before storing the user:

static async signInWithEmail(email: string, password: string):
  Promise<{ success: boolean; user?: AuthUser; error?: AuthError; needsVerification?: boolean }> {
  try {
    const res = await fetch('/api/auth/signin', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password, role: 'patient' })
    });

    const data = await res.json();

    // If server says "verify first"
    if (!res.ok && data?.error?.code === 'EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED') {
      return { success: false, needsVerification: true,
               error: { code: 'EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED', message: data.error.message } };
    }

    if (!res.ok) {
      return { success: false,
               error: { code: data?.error?.code || 'AUTH_ERROR', message: data?.error?.message || 'Sign in failed' } };
    }

    // New account path: server returns user with emailVerified=false
    if (data?.user && data.user.emailVerified === false) {
      return { success: false, needsVerification: true,
               error: { code: 'EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED', message: 'Check your email to verify your account.' } };
    }

    // Verified user
    if (data?.user) {
      safeStorage.setItem('auth_user', JSON.stringify(data.user));
      return { success: true, user: data.user };
    }

    return { success: false, error: { code: 'AUTH_ERROR', message: 'Unexpected auth response' } };
  } catch (err: any) {
    return { success: false, error: { code: 'NETWORK_ERROR', message: err?.message || 'Network error' } };
  }
}


client/src/hooks/registration/useRegistrationAuth.tsx

In handleEmailSignUp and handleEmailSignIn, call AuthService.signInWithEmail.

If needsVerification is true, show a toast like ‚ÄúWe sent a verification link to <email>. Please verify before signing in.‚Äù and route to a VerifyEmailSent page.

Remove any fetch('/api/profiles', { method: 'POST', ... }) calls ‚Äî profile creation should happen inside the auth route.

This single change puts every flow (new user & returning user) behind the same server logic that generates tokens, queues emails, and enforces emailVerified.

B) Make the verification email actually deliver

In your environment (Replit/Vercel/Render/Heroku):

Set SENDGRID_API_KEY to a real key that starts with SG. and has Mail Send permission.

In SendGrid ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication:

Complete Single Sender Verification (quickest) or finish Domain Authentication (more robust).

Use a verified ‚Äúfrom‚Äù address. In code we currently default to info@tranquiloo-app.com. If that address isn‚Äôt a verified Single Sender, change the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù to the verified one or add an env var:

// server/emailService.ts (where we build the email)
from: process.env.SENDGRID_FROM || 'verified-your-email@yourdomain.com',


You already start the queue processor in server/index.ts ‚Äî keep that üëç

With a valid API key + verified sender, emails will be real (no longer just logged).

C) Tell users to verify (client UX)

After sign-up, show a ‚ÄúCheck your inbox‚Äù screen if needsVerification is set.

After sign-in for an existing but unverified account, handle the 403 EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED error from the server and show the same CTA.

The server already exposes the verification endpoint:

GET /verify-email?token=‚Ä¶ ‚Üí sets emailVerified=true and shows an HTML success page with a ‚ÄúSign In Now‚Äù link to /login.

D) Plug Google OAuth gaps (small fix)

In /auth/google/callback after creating/fetching a profile, also mark it verified:

// after ensuring profile exists
await storage.verifyEmailByAddress?.(googleUser.email) 
// or implement an update method:
await db.update(profiles).set({ emailVerified: true, updatedAt: new Date() }).where(eq(profiles.email, googleUser.email));


(Or call an explicit storage.updateEmailVerifiedByEmail(email, true) helper.)

üßπ Duplicates / legacy code to remove (or refactor)

These are the top offenders from the treemaps + search:

Supabase remnants (no Supabase client is initialized; these calls do nothing or are dead pathways).
Remove/replace with your REST endpoints:

client/src/components/track-anxiety/TrackAnxietyForm.tsx

client/src/pages/Index.tsx

client/src/pages/Registration.tsx

client/src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx

client/src/pages/TherapistPortal.tsx

client/src/services/*Service.ts (analytics, auth, chat, goals, therapist*, interventionSummary*) ‚Äî any file still calling supabase.*.

Direct ‚Äúcreate profile‚Äù POSTs sprinkled across the client:

useRegistrationAuth.tsx (Google flow) ‚Äî remove that fetch('/api/profiles', { method:'POST'‚Ä¶ }). Let the server do it inside /auth/google/callback or a dedicated /api/auth/sso-complete.

Router duplication

You import both react-router-dom and wouter. Pick one (I recommend react-router-dom) and refactor. Mixing can strand pages (some of your hatched tiles).

Unused auth code

client/src/components/PhoneAuth.tsx, components/ui/input-otp.tsx look unused in the current flow. Delete or wire them intentionally.

(The ‚ÄúTop client orphans by LOC‚Äù table lists more candidates. If you want, I can generate a PR that deletes all orphans or moves them under /legacy so they stop confusing the app.)

üß™ Quick test script (manual)

Sign up with a new email via the UI.

You should get ‚ÄúCheck your inbox‚Äù and no user stored in localStorage.

In console/server logs: ‚ÄúEMAIL WOULD BE SENT‚Äù (simulated) or ‚ÄúReal email sent‚Äù (if configured).

Click the Verify link in the email (or copy from server log if simulating). You‚Äôll get the success page ‚Üí Sign In Now.

Sign in with the same email/password.

Now the server returns success: true, emailVerified: true.

The client stores auth_user and routes to dashboard.

üîê (Optional) tighten password story

Right now there is no password storage or validation. Decide on one of these:

Passwordless (recommended): remove password boxes; always require email verification (magic link) for sign-in.

Passwords: add a hashed_password column, bcrypt on server, implement /api/auth/signup + /api/auth/signin accordingly, and wire resetPassword.

I can sketch either path if you want to move to production-ready auth.

TL;DR fixes to ship first

Switch client to /api/auth/signin (changes in authService.ts + useRegistrationAuth.tsx).

Handle needsVerification on client and show a ‚Äúcheck your email‚Äù page.

Configure SendGrid (API key + verified sender) so verification emails are real.

Remove direct /api/profiles creates from the client (only server creates users).

(Optional quick win) mark Google sign-ins as verified in the callback.

That will get verification emails flowing and users will be forced to verify before they can sign in. If you want, I can follow up with exact diffs for the client hooks and the minimal server tweak to mark Google users verified.
