Absolutely—here’s a tight, tab-by-tab audit of the updated app (v6) focusing on dashboards and the surrounding tabs for patients and therapists. I scanned every page under client/src/pages and ran static “button/handler/routing/auth” checks so I can call out exactly where things look brittle or unfinished.

I also surfaced a live, sortable sheet called “Per-tab metrics (patient & therapist dashboards)” in this chat (and a companion “rest of pages” view). Those show, per page: number of buttons missing handlers, whether you disable buttons while loading, presence of try/catch and toasts, counts of fetch(...) and navigate(...), and whether the page references auth/roles.

Big auth/routing gotchas that affect all tabs

Wrong storage key on login (both roles): several login flows still write localStorage.setItem('user', ...) while the app’s auth context watches auth_user (via AuthService/safeStorage). Result: users “sign in” but the app still behaves as if they’re logged out, or gets into redirect loops.

Fix: never set 'user'. Use safeStorage.setItem('auth_user', JSON.stringify(user)) and (optionally) fire a StorageEvent for same-tab refresh.

Therapist routes aren’t protected: in App.tsx, /therapist-portal and /therapist-dashboard are public. Patient routes are wrapped in ProtectedRoute (via ProtectedAppLayout), but therapist routes are not.

Fix:

<Route path="/therapist-dashboard"
       element={<ProtectedRoute role="therapist"><TherapistDashboard/></ProtectedRoute>} />
<Route path="/therapist-portal"
       element={<ProtectedRoute role="therapist"><TherapistPortal/></ProtectedRoute>} />


Verification policy is inconsistent: email/password allows some unverified therapist logins, Google OAuth blocks them. Users get mixed behavior.

Fix: choose a single rule (either enforce verification for everyone, or send therapists to a grace flow) and apply it uniformly in both email/password and Google paths. On EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED, redirect to /verify.

Patient dashboard & tabs (what I see and what to fix)
Dashboard (pages/Dashboard.tsx)

What’s wrong

8 buttons with no handlers; no try/catch, no toasts; navigate(...) used in places but no data loads (fetch_calls = 0).

Why it hurts

Primary actions do nothing on click; any async work would fail silently; users think the app is frozen.

Fixes

Wire handlers for each action; wrap in try/catch; add an isLoading state to disable buttons during requests; show success/error toasts.

If tiles are meant to show stats, actually fetch or memoize data (or show a skeleton/empty-state).

Chat (pages/Chat.tsx)

What’s wrong

Buttons are present and wired, but no try/catch and no disabled-while-sending state; no explicit fetches (may be socket-based, but errors aren’t surfaced).

Why it hurts

Message sends can fail with no user feedback; double-submits possible.

Fixes

Add isSending guard; toast network errors; keep the send button disabled while sending; add “retry” on failure.

Chat History (pages/ChatHistory.tsx)

What’s wrong

Similar to Chat: wired, but no error handling and no loading guards.

Fixes

Add loading/empty-state and error toasts; debounce filters/search if present.

Analytics (pages/Analytics.tsx)

What’s good

Has try/catch and toasts.

What to tighten

No fetch_calls detected—if the charts are static or mock data, add a visible empty-state when real data returns 0; include a range picker guard (disable while loading).

Treatment Resources (pages/TreatmentResources.tsx)

What’s wrong

Navigations present, but no auth references in the page (protection comes from the route wrapper only).

Fixes

Keep it under ProtectedAppLayout (already done). Add error toasts when external links fail to open; consider link tracking and async guard for “Open Resource”.

Find Therapist (pages/FindTherapist.tsx)

What’s wrong

4 missing handlers; has TODOs; does use disabled-while-loading and has try/catch.

Fixes

Wire up “Request/Connect/Book” buttons; finish TODOs (search filters, pagination, and therapist card actions); validate inputs and guard against double requests.

Contact Therapist (pages/ContactTherapist.tsx)

What’s good

Has try/catch, toast, and one fetch.

What to tighten

Add an isSending disable on submit; validate subject/message; navigate on success (e.g., back to Chat or Therapist Info).

Notifications (pages/Notifications.tsx)

What’s wrong

8 missing handlers; no useAuth reference, so this page isn’t using the user context directly; no try/catch.

Why it hurts

“Mark as read”/“Clear all” likely do nothing; without user context, you risk mixing global/mock state with per-user notifications.

Fixes

Add handlers for mark-as-read/clear; use the current user id from useAuth; add toasts and disabled/loading states.

Settings (pages/Settings.tsx)

What’s good

Has try/catch, toasts, and multiple navigations; uses auth.

What to tighten

Ensure Sign Out calls the same AuthService used by login and clears auth_user (not user), then redirects; guard destructive actions with confirms.

Therapist dashboard & tabs (what I see and what to fix)

Important: These pages are not currently wrapped in ProtectedRoute. Anyone can hit the URLs unless the page self-guards (it doesn’t).

Therapist Dashboard (pages/TherapistDashboard.tsx)

What’s wrong

2 missing handlers; has try/catch, toasts, and a couple of fetches; no role guard in the page; route is public.

Fixes

Wire the missing actions; add isLoading on async actions; wrap the route in <ProtectedRoute role="therapist">…</ProtectedRoute>.

Therapist Portal (pages/TherapistPortal.tsx)

What’s good

References role/auth concepts; sizeable page (837 lines) suggests it’s a hub.

What’s wrong

Route is public; relies on the page to “behave,” but not on an auth gate.

Fixes

Protect route with role="therapist"; consider chunking heavy sections and adding suspense/loading boundaries so the portal doesn’t feel sluggish.

Therapist Info (pages/TherapistInfo.tsx)

What’s wrong

No explicit useAuth; public route; relies entirely on public access.

Fixes

If this contains sensitive content, guard with ProtectedRoute role="therapist"; otherwise, ensure no PII/user data is shown when accessed anonymously.

Therapist License Verification (pages/TherapistLicenseVerification.tsx)

What’s good

Has isLoading disabling, try/catch, toasts, and multiple fetches.

What to tighten

Decide policy: must a therapist complete this before hitting dashboard? If yes, add a server-side and client-side redirect to this page when licenseVerified === false.

Cross-tab polish items

Consistent toasts & loading states: a few tabs (Dashboard, Chat/History, Notifications) don’t disable buttons or show error feedback. Add a small helper:

const withAsync = (fn: () => Promise<void>, setLoading) => async () => {
  try { setLoading(true); await fn(); toast.success('Done'); }
  catch (e) { toast.error(parseError(e)); }
  finally { setLoading(false); }
};


Route constants everywhere: replace string paths in navigate(...) with ROUTES.* to eliminate typos and keep web/mobile route names distinct.

Empty-state UX: for Analytics, ChatHistory, and Resources, make empty states explicit (“No messages yet”, “No data for this range”, etc.) instead of showing blank screens.

Finish TODOs: at least one user-facing page (FindTherapist) still has TODOs; those typically correspond to missing buttons/handlers.

Quick code changes that will fix the most visible issues

Protect therapist pages in App.tsx:

<Route path="/therapist-portal"
       element={<ProtectedRoute role="therapist"><TherapistPortal/></ProtectedRoute>} />
<Route path="/therapist-dashboard"
       element={<ProtectedRoute role="therapist"><TherapistDashboard/></ProtectedRoute>} />


Fix storage key on login (everywhere you currently do localStorage.setItem('user', ...)):

import { safeStorage } from '@/services/safeStorage';
safeStorage.setItem('auth_user', JSON.stringify(user));
window.dispatchEvent(new StorageEvent('storage', { key: 'auth_user' }));


Uniform verification handling (client):

On EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED, immediately navigate('/verify?redirect=/dashboard') (or therapist dashboard).

Keep a visible “Resend verification” and a “I’ve verified” button that re-pulls the user.

Wire missing handlers (start with the worst offenders from the per-tab sheet):

Dashboard (8), Notifications (8), FindTherapist (4), TherapistDashboard (2).

If you want, I can generate a small patch that:

Wraps the therapist routes in ProtectedRoute role="therapist",

Replaces all localStorage.setItem('user', ...) with the auth_user write via safeStorage,

Adds default isLoading patterns and toasts in the four pages with the most missing handlers.
